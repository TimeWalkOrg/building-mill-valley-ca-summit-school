## Building History

In the 1920s this building was one of the primary elementary schools in Mill Valley. The Summit School was the first and one of the most populated elementary schools in Mill Valley. It served as the only elementary school for all of Mill Valley from 1892 - 1908. The original building on the plot was a one-room building with an enrollment of 35. 

A new, two-story building was erected in the summer of 1890 and then re-modeled in 1895 by Edward R. Swain.  By 1904 the attendance was the third largest in the country. Half a century later (1940), the building was razed, but the public school systemâ€™s presence in Mill Valley never faltered. At the time there were four school buildings with an attendance of approximately 700 and an estimated valuation of $255,000 (equal to $4,606,119 in 2018.) Old Summit School was razed as Mill Valley concluded the celebration of fifty years as a community.

The building was finally demolished in 1941 and the plot (that now holds six homes) was sold for $1,350.

## Design Decisions
- I based my dimensions of the building off of an estimate based on the current size of Old Mill and a floor plan containing some basic dimensions
- I based the height off of an estimate based off of the straight on view with a man looking out the window. I estimated his height, then used this to find the building height.
